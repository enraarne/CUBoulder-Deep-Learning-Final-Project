The jupyter notebook contains Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) that can classify architectural heritage elements into classes, such as altar, apse, bell tower, column, dome (inner), dome (outer), flying buttress, gargoyle, stained glass and vault. The project tries out different types of neural network architectures and hyper parameter tuning, to gain insight into what factors most affect model performance. The data used for in this project can be downloaded from https://correo.cartif.es/home/joslla@cartif.es/Briefcase/Architectural_Heritage_Elements_image_Dataset
